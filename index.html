<h2>Hi!</h2>

<p> I am Pratham Oza, a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at <a href="https://www.ece.vt.edu" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a>. I work with <a href="https://www.ece.vt.edu/people/profile/chantem" target="_blank">Dr. Thidapat (Tam) Chantem</a> at the <a href="https://www.rtx.ece.vt.edu" target="_blank">RTX Lab</a>. My research focus is in the areas of Intelligent Transportation, specifically in Traditional/ Automated Vehicular Traffic Scheduling using real-time systems theories. I completed my Bachelors degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal and my Masters degree at Virginia Tech in 2019.
