<h1>Hi!</h1>

<p> I am Pratham Oza, a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at <a href="https://www.ece.vt.edu" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a>. I work with <a href="https://www.ece.vt.edu/people/profile/chantem" target="_blank">Dr. Thidapat (Tam) Chantem</a> at the <a href="https://www.rtx.ece.vt.edu" target="_blank">RTX Lab</a>. My research focus is in the areas of Intelligent Transportation, specifically in Traditional/ Automated Vehicular Traffic Scheduling using real-time systems theories. I completed my Bachelors degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal and my Masters degree at Virginia Tech in 2019.   
</p>

<p>
Prior to joining Virginia Tech, I worked for about two years with Tata Consultancy Services and a Japanese OEM on vehicular ECU diagnostics and ECU test validation. I have also briefly worked on HILS testing of the Meter ECU in a Japanese OEM vehicle using dSPACE, Vector CANoe and LabView.
